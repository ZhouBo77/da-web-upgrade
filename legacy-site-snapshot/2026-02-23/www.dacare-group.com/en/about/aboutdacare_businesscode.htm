                    <p>The purpose of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 

                      is to promote honest and ethical conduct, focus the Board 

                      of Directors and management of DaCare Inc. on areas of ethical 

                      risk, provide guidance to directors, officers and employees 

                      to help them recognize and deal with ethical issues, provide 

                      mechanisms to report unethical conduct and help to preserve 

                      the culture of honesty and accountability at the Company. 

                    </p>

                    <p><strong>SCOPE AND ADMINISTRATION</strong> </p>

                    <p>This Code applies to all directors, officers and employees 

                      of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries 

                      (each a ¡°Covered Person¡±). If questions exist with respect 

                      to this Code, they should be referred to the Company¡¯s compliance 

                      officer at the earliest possible time. </p>

                    <p><strong>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</strong> </p>

                    <p>Except with the prior knowledge and consent of the Company, 

                      no Covered Person will have a ¡°conflict of interest¡± with 

                      the Company. A conflict of interest occurs when a Covered

                      appears to interfere ¨C with the interests of the Company

                      the types of transactions and relationships that might cause 

                      a conflict of interest and that should be considered as

                      <br>

                      <br>

                      B. Ownership by a Covered Person or any member of his or 

                      her family of a substantial financial interest in any outside

                      from the standpoint of either party, with the Company or 

                      any subsidiary or affiliate, whether as a supplier, dealer, 

                      or customer, or is a competitor of the Company or any subsidiary 

                      or affiliate. <br>

                      <br>

                      C. Substantial management control by a Covered Person or 

                      any member of his or her family of any outside concern that

                      Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, whether as a supplier, 

                      dealer or customer, or is a competitor of the Company or 

                      any subsidiary or affiliate. <br>

                      E. Representation of the Company by a Covered Person in 

                      any transaction in which the Covered Person or any member

                      her family of improper personal benefits as a result of 

                      the Covered Person¡¯s position in the Company, such as gifts 

                      of more than token value, loans to, or guarantees of obligations 

                      of, the Covered Person or any member of his or her family 

                      (other than from established banking or financial institutions), 

                      excessive entertainment, or other substantial favors from 

                      any outside concern or individual which does or is seeking 

                      to do business with, or is a competitor of, the Company 

                      or any subsidiary or affiliate. <br>

                      G. Disclosure or use of confidential information for the 

                      personal profit or advantage of the Covered Person or anyone 

                      else. The foregoing list is only a guide to assist Covered 

                      Persons in identifying potential conflicts of interest. 

                      The existence of a conflict of interest can be determined

                      and to win or award business based on excellence of service 

                      and competitive pricing, not through unethical or questionable

                      All Company assets should be used for a legitimate business 

                      purpose. The misuse or removal from Company facilities of 

                      Company assets is prohibited, unless specifically authorized

                      It is also the Company¡¯s policy to prohibit retaliation 

                      against Covered Persons who report actual or apparent violations
