and rose petals for Trent Croad. Well done the lot of you.<br>
Not just for further besmirching Australia's reputation for poor <br>
sportsmanship, but for continuing the tradition of Australian violence in <br>
these international rules series.<br>
To see Johnson doing his Charles Atlas thing on Friday was cringe-making. <br>
He'd been huffing and puffing all night, looking to make a statement and <br>
when Philip Jordan ran past, the opportunity presented itself: out went <br>
Johnson's arm, down went Jordan.<br>
Jordan, like all Gaelic players, is an amateur. In fact, the County Tyrone <br>
man is an accountant by trade, which means most of his strength work might <br>
be done by pressing the buttons on his calculator or clipping coloured <br>
pens into his shirt pocket. He is 82 kilograms; Johnson, who might spend a <br>
dozen hours in the gym each week, is a buffed 89 kilograms.<br>
Not content with that, Johnson then smacked Mattie Forde in the moosh and <br>
took a swing at Anthony Lynch, both Irishmen understandably having taken <br>
umbrage at the treatment meted out to their fallen teammate.</span><br>
<span class="style14">advertisement<br>
A contrite Johnson later apologised to his family and friends. What about <br>
the Irish team? What about the people who'd paid good money to see this <br>
abomination, and those who thought they might spend Friday night indoors <br>
to watch a hybrid series where fostering goodwill was supposed to be as <br>
important as the result?<br>
A special mention must go here to Australian coach Kevin Sheedy, who must <br>
surely have kissed the Blarney Stone full on the lips in a previous life.<br>
Straight-faced, he blamed the Irish for the violence, saying they'd been <br>
niggling all night with the &quot;un-Australian&quot; tactic of tripping. Presumably <br>
then, when his Essendon full-back, Dustin Fletcher, who has faced the <br>
tribunal four times on tripping-related charges, decides to stick out his <br>
leg again, Sheedy will have no problem when an opponent turns around and <br>
gives him the Chris Johnson-patented forearm jolt.<br>
Hodge and Milburn did themselves an injustice, too. Neither player could <br>
be accused of lacking courage but when was the last time they went <br>
headhunting in the AFL? Hodge says he's a season or two away from being <br>
ready to captain Hawthorn. On the strength of Friday's display  when he <br>
chased an Irish opponent for 30 metres, belting him all the way  I'd say <br>
you could probably add a year or three to that estimation.<br>
So out of line were Johnson and co that regular, mild-mannered, <br>
footy-going folk have bombarded radio stations and newspapers with <br>
expressions of outrage. And it begs the question: what is it about <br>
Australia's insecurity on the sporting field  refer its cricket team ad <br>
nauseam  that it has to resort to such overt physical and verbal <br>
intimidation of opponents?<br>
One columnist, writing in the Irish Independent yesterday, thought he had <br>
the answer: &quot;It's understandable that men with blond highlights, suntans <br>
and names like Lindsay and Shannon are probably going to over-compensate a <br>
bit in terms of machismo.&quot;<br>
Or, in this case, Chris, Luke, Trent and Darren. It's time to wise up and <br>
leave the egos in your AFL locker. If you want to start kicking sand in <br>
opponents' faces, see how you go with Glenn Archer and Jonathan Brown next <br>
