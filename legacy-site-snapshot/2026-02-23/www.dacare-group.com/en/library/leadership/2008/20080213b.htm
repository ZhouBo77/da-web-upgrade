              <p><span class="style7">Today s customers have demanding expectations for quality products and services. To meet them and keep them coming back, you need qualified employees who are as committed to your business as you are. <br>
                  <strong>In just 60-seconds</strong>, well show you how to identify and attract the best people to your small business. <br>
                <strong>0:60 Define the Duties? </strong><br>
                To find promising employees, you must first determine what you want them to do. Carefully consider all direct and associated responsibilities and incorporate them into a written job description. Be careful with general titles such as typist or sales clerk, as they have different meanings to different people. <br>
                <strong>0:49  What it Takes to do Them </strong><br>
                Fulfilling these responsibilities will require some level of skill and experience, even if it is an entry-level position. Be reasonable about your expectations. Setting the bar too high may limit your available talent pool; setting it too low risks a flood of applications from those unqualified for the job. <br>
                <strong>0:37 Make it Worth their While</strong> <br>
                Likewise, you dont want to be overly generous or restrictive about compensation. State and local chambers of commerce, employment bureaus and professional associations can help you determine appropriate wages and benefits. Scanning descriptions of comparable jobs in the classified ads and other employment publications will also provide clues about prevailing wage rates. <br>
                <strong>0:38 Spread the Word </strong><br>
                How you advertise your job opening depends on who you want to attract. Some positions are as easy to promote as posting a ?help wanted? sign in your store window or placing an ad in your local newspaper. For jobs requiring more specialized skills, consider targeted channels such as trade magazines, on-line job banks and employment agencies (though these may require a fee). And don?t overlook <br>
                sources such as friends, neighbors, suppliers customers and present employees. <br>
                <strong>0:25 Talk it Over </strong><br>
                Because you have clearly defined the role and requirements, you should have little difficulty identifying candidates for interviews. Make sure you schedule them when you have ample time to review the resume, prepare your questions and give the candidate your undivided attention. After the interview, jot down any impressions or key points while they?re still fresh in your mind. This will be a valuable reference when it?s time to make a decision. <br>
                <strong>0:12 Follow-up on Interviews </strong><br>
                You want to believe your candidates are being honest, but never assume. Contact references to make sure you?re getting the facts or to clear up any uncertainties. Professional background checks are a wise investment for highly sensitive positions, or those that involve handling substantial amounts of money and valuables. <br>
                <strong>0:03 You have Found Them; Now Keep Them </strong><br>
                Now that you have hired ideal employees, make sure they stay with you by providing training and professional development opportunities. The small business experts at SCORE can help you craft human resource policies and incentive plans that will ensure your company remains the small business employer of choice.</span><br>
