              <p>BEIJING -- Human Resources and Social Security Minister Yin Weimin warned of a &quot;grave&quot; employment situation in China on Tuesday, but said government measures to boost employment have taken &quot;initial effects&quot;.</p>
              <p>With the big drop in company posts, a large number of migrant workers who lost their jobs, and the labor-intensive industry falling as major victim amid global financial downturn, &quot;the employment situation in China is very grave,&quot; he said at a press conference on the sidelines of the parliament's annual full session.</p>
              <p>In face of the grave situation, the Chinese government has taken a series of measures, which have shown &quot;initial effect&quot;, he said.</p>
              <p>In the first two months of this year, China saw &quot;a reverse on the dropping trend&quot; in new labor posts in cities, he said.</p>
              <p>The number of new laborers stood at 690,000 and 930,000 in January and February, compared with 550,000 and 380,000 in November and December last year, according to Yin.</p>
              <p>China recorded the first rise in company posts in February after it dropped for four consecutive months from October last year, he said.</p>
              <p>&quot;It's only a moderate increase of 1 percent, but it's good news,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p>&quot;But can we then judge from the two pieces of good news that our employment situation is turning for the good? I think we should keep on observing the overall economic development,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p>China's export continued the downward tendency in February and will face a &quot;grim&quot; situation in the &quot;coming foreseeable months&quot;, said Chen Deming, Minister of Commerce, at the conference .</p>
              <p>&quot;Affected by the global economic recession, China has undergone negative growth in both import and export since last November,&quot; said Chen.</p>
