              <p class="style7">The courts have ordered 10 pilots of China Eastern Airlines to compensate their employer a total of nearly 8 million yuan ($1.17 million) for leaving their jobs, local media has reported.</p>
              <p class="style7">The Wuhan Intermediate People's Court ruled on Thursday that each of the pilots was to compensate the airline's branch in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, 700,000 to 1 million yuan, depending on their service term and the training programs they received, the Changjiang Times reported.</p>
              <p class="style7">Zhang Hua, who was ordered to pay 700,000 yuan to the airline, told the paper that the ruling was of no surprise to him.</p>
              <p class="style7">Still, he said he did not regret leaving China Eastern.</p>
              <p class="style7">&quot;I don't want to live under constant high pressure,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the newspaper.</p>
              <p class="style7">&quot;I want to work for a company that is humane and that has a relaxed atmosphere.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style7">In May last year, 13 pilots of the Wuhan branch of China Eastern handed in their resignations and were asked to pay a total compensation of more than 100 million yuan. The employer claimed that the money was to compensate it for the investments it made to train the pilots.</p>
              <p class="style7">In August, the provincial labor arbitration committee ordered the 13 pilots to pay more than 9 million yuan to compensate the airline for their departure.</p>
              <p class="style7">Daunted by the large amount, three of the pilots reportedly withdrew their resignations. The remaining 10 pilots brought their case to the Qiaokou District People's Court.</p>
              <p class="style7">The court later announced that the 10 pilots should compensate their employer a total of nearly 10 million yuan. The airline lodged an appeal to the Wuhan Intermediate People's Court, which made the final ruling this Thursday.</p>
              <p class="style7">Zhang Qihuai, a legal expert with the China University of Political Science and Law, said he had told the pilots in a legal consultation that the compensation being ordered by the courts was reasonable, since the amount was about what the company had paid for training the pilots.</p>
              <p class="style7">&quot;Most State-owned carriers in China sign tenure contracts with pilots to prevent them from leaving the company,&quot; Zhang said.</p>
              <p class="style7">Company officials in Wuhan and Shanghai declined to comment on the ruling on Friday.<span class="style7"><br>
