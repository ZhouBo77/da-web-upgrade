              <p class="style7">While Shanghai tries to lure top overseas professionals, representatives of 247 companies in Zhejiang will be visiting the city to attract some its workers to the province.</p>
              <p class="style7">Zhejiang is offering more than 5,000 jobs at a fair to be held in Shanghai on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="style7">The province is seeking managers, administrative directors, executive vice-presidents and vice-presidents.</p>
              <p class="style7">&quot;There are 50 to 60 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Wenzhou participating at this job fair, with several hundred positions available,&quot; Zhou Dewen, chairman of the Wenzhou SMEs development promotion federation, said yesterday.</p>
              <p class="style7">&quot;Wenzhou is keen on attracting professionals from Shanghai,&quot; Zhou said.</p>
              <p class="style7">He said it is part of an overall plan to attract 600,000 mid- to high-level professionals.</p>
              <p class="style7">&quot;Although many SMEs have been hit by a drop in overseas orders due to the current financial crisis, it is still of vital importance to recruit and retain good people,&quot; Zhou said.</p>
              <p class="style7">Zhejiang is offering a number of perks in its recruit drive - granting of residential status, subsidized education for children, and spouse employment. &quot;We are offering a salary package 10 to 15 percent higher than anywhere else in China,&quot; Zhou said.</p>
              <p class="style7">The Shanghai University of Finance &amp; Economics (SUFE) has urged its students to attend the job fair.</p>
              <p class="style7">Ruan Shan, a second-year SUFE student majoring in tourism management, said that her schoolmates, mostly finance majors, are suffering greatly from the global financial crisis.</p>
              <p class="style7">&quot;Even those few corporations that are continuing to recruit, have drastically cut down on numbers,&quot; she said.</p>
              <p class="style7">Although there is still more than six months to go before graduation, Ruan and her classmates have attended many job interviews, but have received no offers.</p>
              <p class="style7">Ruan said she will attend the job fair. &quot;I have lowered my expectations. All I want is just a job here, so long as it pays about 3,000 yuan, ($440) after tax,&quot; she said.</p>
