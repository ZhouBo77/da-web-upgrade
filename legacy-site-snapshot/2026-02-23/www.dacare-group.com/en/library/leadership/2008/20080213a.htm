              <p><span class="style7">THE Walt Disney Co. said it signed Chief Executive Robert Iger to a new five-year contract that will pay him an annual salary of $2 million plus bonuses and stock awards that could be worth millions more. <br>
                Under the deal announced Friday, Iger could receive an annual incentive bonus of $10 million or more, along with an annual long-term incentive compensation equity award valued at $9 million or more, if Disney meets certain performance goals, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. <br>
                Iger's previous contract included an annual performance bonus beginning at $7.25 million and annual long-term incentive compensation starting at $8 million. <br>
                The new deal also calls for the executive to receive a stock option grant for the purchase of 3 million shares of Disney common stock at the exercised price of $29.50 a share. <br>
                In addition, the compensation package includes perks and benefits in line with what Disney gives other senior executives, according to the filing. <br>
                The executive's previous contract was set to expire Sept. 30, 2010. His new contract runs through Jan. 31, 2013. <br>
                In a statement, the board of directors of the Burbank, Calif.-based company praised Iger's job performance, noting the executive has presided over record revenues, net income and earnings per share since being named CEO on Sept. 30, 2005.<br>
&quot;Bob is a talented and visionary leader, under whom Disney has posted increases in growth and profitability that have consistently exceeded expectations,&quot; said John E. Pepper Jr., Disney's chairman.<br>
              Disney, which operates film studios, theme parks, TV cable channels and other businesses, ended fiscal 2007 on an upswing, posting annual profit of $4.69 billion, or $2.25 per share, compared with $3.37 billion, or $1.64 per share, in fiscal 2006.<br>
              Its revenue rose to $35.51 billion from $33.75 billion in the same period. Iger, who also holds the title of president, received a compensation package valued by the company at $27.7 million in fiscal 2007, according to an analysis of documents by The Associated Press.<br>
              Iger received a salary of $2 million, non-equity incentive plan compensation of $13.7 million, other compensation of $745,177, and stock and option awards that had an estimated value of about $11.2 million when granted.<br>
              Disney also signed Chief Financial Officer Thomas O. Staggs to a new five-year contract that runs through April 1, 2013.<br>
              Staggs will be paid a base salary of $1.25 million in the first year of the contract. He'll receive a $75,000 increase each of the next two years and a $50,000 hike each of the last two years of the deal, according to the filing.
              <br>
              Staggs also could receive an annual bonus equal to twice his annual base salary or more, and a long-term incentive award valued at three times his annual base salary or more, depending on his job performance.<br>
                The executive also was awarded 250,000 restricted stock units. </span><br>
