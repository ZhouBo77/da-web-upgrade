                    <strong>DaCare's Privacy Commitment - Overview</strong><br>

                    <br>

                    DaCare is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. 

                    We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. The following 

                    statement explains DaCare's commitment to managing your personal 

                    information and sets out how and when personal information 

                    is collected, held, used or disclosed. <br>

                    <br>

                    <strong>Information About All DaCare Visitors <br>

                    </strong><br>

                    We gather information about all of our users collectively, 

                    such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services 

                    users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and 

                    in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what 

                    is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually 

                    create a better overall experience for you. We may share this 

                    information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, 

                    so that they too may understand how DaCare visitors use our 

                    site, and also create a better overall experience for you. 

                    We do not disclose information about your individual visits 

                    to DaCare to any outside parties, except when the law requires 

                    it.<br>

                    <br>

                    <strong>Information About You Specifically</strong><br>

                    <br>

                    DaCare is a career site, we retain your personal information 

                    to assist in your career performance or management including 

                    finding or retaining work; or to facilitate other services 

                    to or by us.<br>

                    For example, when you sign up to use a service, enter into 

                    a contest, or purchase a product, we collect more specific 

                    personal information about you, such as your name, address, 

                    email address, telephone number, credit card number, qualifications 

                    or career history. <br>

                    If you choose to do so we may also retain sensitive information 

                    about you such as information about your membership in a professional 

                    or trade association or trade union. <br>

                    We may also ask you for other information, such as information 

                    on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, 

                    the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort 

                    to deliver to you the best possible site experience. When 

                    you grant us your permission, we will communicate with you 

                    regularly with tips, advice and survey information on using 

                    the DaCare site to maximise your career development. DaCare 

                    also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these 

                    types of communications. If you choose to receive these types 

                    of communications at the time of registration, but later decide 

                    you no longer want to receive them, simply log in to your 

                    My DaCare account and edit your account profile.<br>

                    If you input your information on a co-branded registration 

                    page, such as that of a DaCare and partner company-sponsored 

                    contest, then your information will be collected, used and 

                    becomes the property of both DaCare and the partner co-sponsoring 

                    the contest. In that instance, DaCare is not responsible for 

                    the information that the partner company receives or how it 

                    is used. <br>

                    If you do not provide us with the information sought in the 

                    required fields DaCare may be limited in its ability to provide 

                    you with services.<br>
